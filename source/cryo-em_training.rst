=======================================
Cryo-EM Training - Basic (level I & II)
=======================================
          (Each session is set 2 - 2.5 hours)

**Goal** is to help a new user coming to EM field to command some basic knowledge of Cryo-EM. And by the end of this two levels of training sessions, you can screen your negative stained specimen and cryo grids on scope without too much difficult.

**Requirement** You are not required to have experience with TEM operation. The only requirement to you, the fresh trainee,  is to have a spirit of commitment. You need to be determined to learn this new technique. If you think to have your data collected while in your training session and have your project done half way, you should not attend the training session I offer. You will be wasting your own time, let alone mine. Usually, if an user doesn't take good note during training session and doesn't come back practise on microscope, that is a good hint that the user is wasting time of everyone. Operating a transmission electron microscope is very much like to drive a car, but much harder. 

Level I - Basic TEM Operation (4 sessions)
------------------------------------------

**Session I - 1**

- Prepare continous carbon film grid
- Introduction to TEM; breif history; comapre to X-ray as beam source
- Basic TEM Operation on Tecnai G2 system
- User Interface & Vacuum system

**Session I - 2**

- Specimen rod insertion and retraction
- Tuning microscope (Eucentricity, gun alignment, filament saturation, beam-tilt pivot points, rotation center)
- C2 aperture centering, C2 lens stigmation; Obj. aperture centering, Obj lens stigmation
- Correct side of beam spreading
- Demo and instroduce CTF concept

**Session I - 3**

- Negative Stain sample preparation
- Refreshing microscope tuning procedure
- Introduce digital cameras - hardware component, background preparation, pixelsize at levels of detector and specimen
- Introduce DQE, and latest status of direct electron detectors
- Negative stain specimen imaging using CCD

**Session I - 4**
