Cryo-EM Training - Basic (level I & II)
=======================================
          (Each session is set 2 - 2.5 hours)

*Goal* is to help a new user coming to EM field to command some basic knowledge of Cryo-EM. And by the end of this two levels of training sessions, you can screen your negative stained specimen and cryo grids on scope without too much difficult.

*Requirement* You are not required to have experience with TEM operation. The only requirement to you, the fresh trainee,  is to have a spirit of commitment. You need to be determined to learn this new technique. If you think to have your data collected whil in your training session and have your project done half way, you should not attend the training session I offer. You will be wasting your own time, at alone mine. Usually, if an user doesn't take good note during training session and doesn't come back practise on microscope, that is a good hint that the user is wasting time of everyone. Operating a transmission electron microscope is very much like to drive a car, but much harder. 

Level I - Basic TEM Operation (4 sessions)
