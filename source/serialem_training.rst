 Goal 
    This is to provide hands-on training on SerialEM. I will teach basic functions of the program. And I will teach how to use the powerful program for electron tomography data collection, and for single particle application as well. 

 Requirement 
    You are required to have basic knowledge for TEM operation, preferred for Tecnai/Titan/Talos system. You should be able to operate scope independently to get a properly foused image. You are now required, however, to have pre-knowledge of SerialEM itself. 

This document lists the training contents that the three catagories - basics, tomography and single particle. 

.. .. note:: This is important!

.. _basic:

SerialEM - Basics (3 sessions)
------------------------------

.. rubric:: Session 1

- Introduction to SerialEM, launch and exit the program. Explain system files and user setting file.
- Explain how SerialEM controls microscope and camera, and its relationship with microscope and camera control software interface. 
- explain interface and layout - control panels and menus
- Camera setup, how to acquire an image from SerialEM interface
- Demo basic function such as Eucentricity (and shift beam to tilting axis)

.. rubric:: Session 2

- Refresh Tune-scope procedure
- Prepare gain reference file in SerialEM
- Explain image buffers and how to save buffer image into file, explain MRC stack and modes 
- Image Shift and Stage Shift
- Eucentricity, Autofocus and montaging
- Explain pixelsize and dose/dose rate.

.. rubric:: Session 3

- Introduce Navigator - navigater items: map, point and polygon  
- Demo full grid montage, Medium Map Montage (Using Image Shift and Stage Shift)
- Realign To Nav Item, demo and explain
- demo acquire map or image at multiple points ...
- introduce script/macro

.. _Tomography:

SerialEM - Tomography (5 sessions)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Session 1

- demo and explain how to collect a tilting series
- explain cooking resin specimen, defocus and other parameters (mag, binning etc.)
- explain proper sample preparation for platic sections (thickness, gold beads etc.)

.. rubric:: Session 2

- Ask user to acquire MMM maps and collect a tilting series to comment on the condition
- Setup montage tilting series
- Setup batch mode for multiple locations

.. rubric:: Session 3

- demo and explain dual axis tomography data collection
- demo how to rotate grid 90 degree and find the same location (registration tramsformation)

.. rubric:: Session 4

- Low dose mode setup for Cryo Tomography applications
- refresh cryo sample and holder handeling

.. rubric:: Session 5
 
- LMM, MMM in low dose mode
- bi-directional tilting series collection
- batch mode for cryo data collection.
