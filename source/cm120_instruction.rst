   Abstract
      This document tries to list steps and procedures for a typical daily operation on CM120. 
      You can use it as guidebook to help you when you are sitting with CM120, especially if 
      you are a new user. I here assume you are already familiar with scope interface, what 
      the knobs and buttons do etc.. You might use the section titles as quick bullet p ints, 
      but the explanation inside each sections are supposed to be useful and informative. 
      

      If you have suggestion how to improve this document to make it more useful, please 
      feel free to let me know. Thank you!

.. _check-logbook:

Check log book to see if there have been any problems
-----------------------------------------------------

It is always a good idea to check the LOG book. You can find useful information listed there, such as:

- If there have been any recent problems with the scope.
- The conditions that were used last, especially the filament saturation.
- Any special note that last user wants you to know.

 .. _check-vacuum-status:

Check vacuum status
-------------------

The status must be Ready before you can operate the scope. If not, you should ask for help and 
report it to the manager. Usually, if the vacuum is not ready, it is due to one of the following reasons:

- The scope is malfunctioning.
- The air pressure is not within a good range(the building compressed air may be down?).
- The cooling water is off.

Vacuum being Ready means:

- Top line of vacuum page shows "ready".
- P3 < 50, IGP < 26 (normally, they are shown 0, 5).
- LEDs for UVAC and HiVAC are lit.
