    We no longer use film for TEM exposure anymore! Instead, we use digital camera. There are basically two types of digital 
    cameras available on the market for TEM applications - Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) and Direct Electron Detector. On CM120, 
    there are two cameras installed - Gatan Orius model 832 and Tietz TemCam 224-HD. They both are CCD type of cameras. In this 
    document, I give information about basic properties of the cameras, how to use them with CM120 and specific technical note 
    for why we need use them in such way.

  It also lists pixelsize information for both cameras so you can decide which magnification you want to use for your final image. 
  I also try to show you how to use SerialEM to control them.
