   Abstract
      This protocol is based on MRC LMB one. And we got some ideas from Xudong Wu at Harvard Medical School.
      
      
.. _material:

Materials and Equipment Used:
-----------------------------

1. GO Solution (Sigma:763705, 2 mg/ml)
#. ddH20
#. Tweezers
#. Pipette (1 µl, 3 µl and 20 µl)
#. Tabletop centrifuge
#. Parafilm
#. Whatman filter paper No1

.. _procedure:

Procedure:
----------

1. Dilute GO solution 10x to 0.2 mg/mL with ddH\ :sub:`2`\ O
2. Spin for 30 seconds at 300 rcf to remove aggregates
3. Prepare a flat and clean working area (e.g. with parafilm)
4. Further dilute GO solution 10x to 0.02 mg/mL with ddH\ :sub:`2`\ O
5. Glow discharge grids with carbon side up (easiGlow (PELCO, Discharge System); Quantifoil Cu 300 R1.2/1.3 120 seconds at 0.2 mBar and 15 mA)
6. Take up grids with anti-capillary tweezers
7. Place 1µl of the diluted GO solution (4) on the carbon side of the grid
8. Wait for the grid to dry out

.. Note::

   1. This method is good for high coverage of GO, but maybe get multiple layers of GO on the grid. 
   2. Discharging conditions are varied between grids and discharge system.
